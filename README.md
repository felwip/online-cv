# Online-CV
https://confident-galileo-b98b24.netlify.com/

## Idea
As a practice I want to find a nice way to represent a Curriculum Vitae online. It can be extended and restructured for practice purposes. Also the updated version could be used within future applications.

## Inspiration
As an Inspiration I saw an animated CV some time ago. When you are looking up examples on google, you will find several nice designs. For now I will stick to simply give it a structure that makes sense.

## Resources
This is written as a Markdown practice. So Markdown code and HTML will be in use as a start. You can copy / fork the repository in order to create your own online-cv.
